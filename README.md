## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)
- **Data Type:** Yellow Taxi Trip Records (monthly Parquet files)
- **Format:** Parquet (raw) → CSV (cleaned)

Due to Tableau Public limitations with Parquet files, the raw data is converted and cleaned using Python before visualization.
